Who know how long I have love you Do you know I love you still Will I wait a lonely lifetime If you want me to I will For if I ever saw you I did not catch your name But it never really mattered I will always fill the same Love you forever and forever Love you with all my heart Love you whenever we are together Love you when we are apart And when at last I find you Your song will fill the air Sing it loud so I can hear you Make it easy to be near you For the things to do endear me to you how you know I will I will
